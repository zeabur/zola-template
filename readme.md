# Zola Template

[![Deploy with Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/button.svg)](https://zeabur.com/)

A fast static site generator in a single binary with everything built-in.

Documentation is available on its site or in the docs/content folder of the repository and the community can use its forum.

This tool and the template engine it is using were born from an intense dislike of the (insane) Golang template engine and therefore of Hugo that I was using before for 6+ sites.
